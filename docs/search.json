    "text": "About me\nPrior to my Masters, I had brief stint as a Data & Applied Scientist at Microsoft where I developed forecasting models and support capacity planning. I worked on problems like Holiday Seasonality, integrating Deep Learning times series model.\nMy major research experience comes from my time at Aira Matrix (Sun Pharmaceuticals), where I collaborated with University College London (UCL) on detecting and classifying high-grade tumors using 3D prostate MRIs. This project introduced me to 3D image registration, rendering, and segmentation. I began my full-time role as an AI Engineer at Aira Matrix in July 2023, after completing my college studies. I contributed to the development of Aira Prostate, a solution for Gleason grading of prostate histopathology, by enhancing the inference speed of the segmentation model and incorporating a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) classification.\nIâ€™m particularly interested in topics related to self-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, and Representations. These areas fascinate me because of their potential to revolutionize AI and address complex challenges in various domains. Open for Research Opportunities in Academia."
