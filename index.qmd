<!-- Hi! I am Bibhabasu, welcome to my page.

I am a Masters Student at Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen. My academic interests center around Probabilistic Machine Learning and its integration into modern AI systems to enhance explainability, safety, and truthfulness.

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at Microsoft, focusing on cloud supply chain planning for Azure Compute and Storage devices. Before that, I was an AI Engineer at Aira Matrix, specializing in Computer Vision for Medical Imaging, particularly prostate cancer diagnostics.

I have hands-on experience across a wide range of Deep Learning and Computer Vision domains, including Image Segmentation, 3D Computer Vision, Representation Learning, and NLP.

## [About me](/)


Prior to my Masters, I had brief stint as a **Data & Applied Scientist** at **Microsoft** where I developed forecasting models and support capacity planning. I worked on problems like Holiday Seasonality, integrating Deep Learning times series model.

My major research experience comes from my time at **Aira Matrix (Sun Pharmaceuticals)**, where I collaborated with University College London (UCL) on detecting and classifying high-grade tumors using 3D prostate MRIs. This project introduced me to 3D image registration, rendering, and segmentation. I began my full-time role as an **AI Engineer** at Aira Matrix in July 2023, after completing my college studies. I contributed to the development of Aira Prostate, a solution for Gleason grading of prostate histopathology, by enhancing the inference speed of the segmentation model and incorporating a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) classification.

I'm particularly interested in topics related to self-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, and Representations. These areas fascinate me because of their potential to revolutionize AI and address complex challenges in various domains. Open for Research Opportunities in Academia.
